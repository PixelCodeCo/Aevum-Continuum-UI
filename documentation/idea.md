# Timeline Enhancement Ideas

## 1. Period Backgrounds
- Faint colored bands behind the timeline that match each period
- Smooth gradient transitions between periods as you pan
- Creates visual context for "where you are in history"

## 2. Viewport Indicator / Mini-map
- Small overview bar showing the full timeline with a rectangle indicating your current view
- Click to jump to different eras

## 3. Era Indicator
- Floating badge showing the current dominant period name (e.g., "Medieval Period")
- Updates as you pan through time

## 4. Edge Fog/Fade
- Subtle gradient fade at the edges of the viewport
- Creates depth and focus on the center

## 5. Event Clustering
- When zoomed out far, cluster nearby events into a single marker with count
- Expand on zoom

## 6. Animated Zoom to Event
- Click an event to smoothly zoom and center on it

## 7. Time Ruler
- A dynamic ruler showing the scale (e.g., "1 cm = 100 years" that updates with zoom)
